[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/üöÄ%20Live%20Demo-Streamlit-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge)](https://stock-price-predictor2.streamlit.app/)  
*(Replace `YOUR_STREAMLIT_APP_URL` with your deployed Streamlit app link)*  

A machine learning-powered web application built with Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit that predicts the next-day stock price and future movement (Up/Down) of a chosen stock.  

The app uses historical stock data (via yfinance), trains multiple regression and classification models, and provides backtesting metrics along with forecast results.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. Data Collection  
   - Fetches stock data using Yahoo Finance (yfinance).  
   - User inputs ticker & training period.  

2. Feature Engineering  
   - Sliding window method: last N days (window_size) ‚Üí predict next day.  

3. Model Training & Backtesting  
   - Walk-forward validation ensures real-world-like testing.  
   - Regression predicts price, classification predicts Up/Down.  

4. Forecasting  
   - Models retrained on full data.  
   - Predicts next trading day‚Äôs price & direction.
